 *   live HTTP request, or a live Shannon invocation) and produced at least
 *   one discovery or observation.
 * - `EXECUTED_NO_RESULTS` — a real adapter genuinely ran and completed
 *   successfully, but found nothing this time (e.g. a scan/probe that
 *   legitimately matched zero targets). This is still a real execution,
 *   never conflated with `FAILED`: a tool that ran fine and found nothing
 *   is a different fact from a tool that errored, and treating the two the
 *   same would make "no results" look like a broken tool on every clean
 *   scan.
 * - `MOCKED` — a caller-supplied investigation fixture or captured Shannon
 *   output stood in for a real run; never presented as "executed".
 * - `UNAVAILABLE` — a real adapter was selected but reported itself not
 *   capable (binary missing/misidentified, credential absent) before ever
 *   running.
 * - `BLOCKED_BY_SCOPE` — the target failed the pre-execution scope check.
 * - `BLOCKED_BY_POLICY` — budget, rate limit, or another deterministic
 *   policy rule stopped execution before the tool ran.
 * - `FAILED` — the tool genuinely ran and exited with an error.
