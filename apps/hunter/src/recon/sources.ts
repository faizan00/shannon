/**
 * Recon source abstraction + capability detection.
 *
 * `ReconSource` is the common interface for every passive/active recon
 * input (subfinder, amass, chaos, certificate transparency, gau/
 * waybackurls, httpx, katana, …). The only implementation this package
 * exercises automatically is `LocalFixtureReconSource`, which reads a local
 * JSON file of discoveries — this is what backs the offline simulation and
 * dry-run mode. `isToolInstalled` genuinely checks (via `which`, no
 * arguments to the tool itself) whether a real binary is present on PATH,
 * so a future `CommandLineReconSource` can decide whether it is even
 * possible to run before doing so — "detect capabilities before execution,"
 * never assume a tool is installed.

 * than failing the whole recon phase. Result order is not meaningful —
 * callers (`recon/correlate.ts`, `worldmodel/graph.ts:upsertNode`)
 * group/merge by (kind, label), never by array position.
 *
 * `maxConcurrency` defaults to `sources.length` — every source still fires
 * at once, exactly as before this parameter existed — so no existing caller
 * changes behavior. A caller that wants a real cap (bounding how many
 * concurrent outbound requests a live bootstrap or round-loop tool-bridge

 * throwing source still lets every other source's result through — but
 * `onSourceComplete` fires the instant *that individual source's* own
 * promise settles, not after the whole batch does. This is the difference
 * that lets a caller (`pipeline/adaptive-loop.ts`'s bootstrap phase) fold a
 * fast source's discoveries into the world model — and make them eligible
 * for correlation/hypothesis generation — while a slower sibling source is
 * still running, instead of waiting for every source to finish before any
 * of them can influence anything.
 *
 * `onSourceComplete` is called with an empty `discoveries` array (never
 * skipped) for a source that was unavailable or threw, so a caller tracking
 * "how many sources have reported in" gets an accurate count either way.
 * Callback ordering is whatever real completion order the sources settle
 * in — deliberately not sorted or batched — and a callback's own
 * synchronous body always finishes before the next source's `then` can run
 * (JavaScript has no preemptive threading), so a caller mutating shared
 * state directly inside the callback never needs its own lock.
 *
 * `maxConcurrency` defaults to `sources.length` (every source fires at
 * once, identical to behavior before this parameter existed) — see
 * `runReconSources`'s docstring for why that default is safe to add without
 * touching any existing caller or test.
