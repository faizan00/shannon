/**
 * Snapshot-based bridge from real HackerOne program intelligence into
 * `ProgramDiscoveryProvider`.
 *
 * This package has zero third-party dependencies and makes no network calls
 * of its own anywhere (see `intake/hackerone.ts`'s `HackerOneApiIntake`
 * stub, and the root README's safety model) — that stays true here too.
 * `h1-brain` (the `mcp__h1-brain__*` tools: `search_programs`,
 * `fetch_program_scopes`, `hack`, `search_disclosed_reports`, …) is only
 * reachable by the orchestrating agent session, not by this Node package,
 * so it cannot be called from inside `discoverPrograms()` no matter how
 * this module is written.
 *
 * The honest integration point is a snapshot file: the operator or
 * orchestrating agent calls the real h1-brain tools, and writes what they
 * returned to a local JSON file shaped like `H1BrainSnapshot` below — then
 * `H1BrainSnapshotProvider` reads it exactly like
 * `discovery/fixture-provider.ts` reads its own fixture, with the same
 * "never touches the network" property. This is the same shape of honesty
 * `intake/hackerone.ts:LocalFileIntake` already has for a single program's
 * scope, extended to many candidate programs.
 *
 * `normalizeSnapshotProgram` only ever derives a signal from a field that is
 * actually present in the snapshot — a program with no bounty range in its
 * snapshot gets no `bountyAttractiveness` signal at all, never an invented
 * one (see `discovery/scoring.ts`'s handling of `missingSignals`).
