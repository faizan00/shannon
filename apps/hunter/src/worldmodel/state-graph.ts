/**
 * Application state / workflow graph.
 *
 * Represents the target application as a behavioral state machine —
 * actor/role/auth-state -> action -> resource -> authorization decision ->
 * side effect -> next state — built from *observed* transitions (never
 * assumed). Kept as its own persisted store, parallel to `worldmodel/graph.ts`
 * and `worldmodel/provenance.ts`, for the same reason: a workflow
 * transition carries fields (actor, role, authorization outcome, resource)
 * that a generic structural node/edge never needs.
 *
 * The point is not to draw a diagram: `detectUnexpectedTransitions` and
 * `detectAuthorizationInconsistencies` are what turn this graph into
 * generic behavioral-security hypotheses — never hardcoded to one
 * vulnerability class.
