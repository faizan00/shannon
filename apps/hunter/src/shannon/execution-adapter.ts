/**
 * Shannon execution adapter — the real live-execution lifecycle.
 *
 * `planShannonAction` is always safe to call: it checks eligibility (a real
 * local repo must exist) and builds the exact verified invocation, without
 * running anything. `executeShannonAction` is the only function in this
 * entire package that can actually spawn the Shannon CLI, and it refuses
 * outright unless `confirmed: true` is passed explicitly — nothing in
 * `pipeline/adaptive-loop.ts` ever sets that automatically just because a
 * reasoning provider (Claude or heuristic) selected a "shannon" action.
 * Live execution requires a separate, explicit operator confirmation on
 * top of the normal scope/eligibility gates.
 *
 * `spawnImpl` is injectable so tests can verify the full lifecycle
 * (argument construction, stdout/stderr capture, exit-code handling,
 * report discovery) without ever spawning a real process.

 *
 * Trace (`apps/worker/src` in this monorepo, read directly, not executed):
 * `temporal/activities.ts` writes `report.json` under
 * `deliverablesDir(input.repoPath, input.deliverablesSubdir)`
 * (`paths.ts:deliverablesDir` = `path.join(repoPath, ...subdir.split('/'))`),

 * (`shannon/config.ts:buildShannonInvocation`) never passes a config file
 * that could override that default. This matches the root `CLAUDE.md`'s own
 * "Deliverables" bullet ("Saved to `.shannon/deliverables/` in the target
 * repo"). Shannon's *workspace* directory (`~/.shannon/workspaces/<name>/`
 * in the npx mode this package always uses — see `apps/cli/src/home.ts`)
 * holds logs, session state, and a rendered copy of the report — never the
 * structured `report.json` findings this function ingests.
 *
 * A production-readiness audit found that this function previously searched
 * Hunter's own `workspaceDir` instead — a directory with no real connection
 * to where Shannon writes anything — and every test masked the gap by
 * manually pre-writing a fake `report.json` into whatever (wrong) location
 * the code happened to search, rather than the real one. This fixes the
 * search target itself; the depth-bounded recursive fallback below stays
 * only as defense-in-depth against an unexpected repo layout, never as the
