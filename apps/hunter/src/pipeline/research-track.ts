/**
 * Research track.
 *
 * The upgrade from "advanced scanner" to "autonomous security researcher":
 * anomaly detection, the research cascade, the provenance graph, the
 * application state/workflow graph, the authorization matrix, attack-path
 * discovery, the experiment designer, adversarial validation, and hunt
 * memory, all genuinely wired into one executed pass rather than existing
 * as orphaned modules.
 *
 * Deliberately kept as its own hypothesis/action/finding space, separate
 * from `pipeline/adaptive-loop.ts`'s primary `checkpoint.hypotheses` and
 * winner-selection: the primary loop is a well-tested, working MVP
 * pipeline (one hypothesis per action, matched strictly by id) and this
 * track must never be able to steal an action slot from it or change which
 * hypothesis its own tests expect to win. Both tracks execute through the
 * exact same primitives, though — `pipeline/tool-bridge.ts:executeActionViaRegistry`,
 * `reasoning/policy.ts`'s rate limiter, `findings/lifecycle.ts`'s state
 * machine, `evidence/store.ts`'s redaction — never a *second*, duplicate
 * execution implementation. Real experiment execution only happens when
 * the caller supplies `liveRecon`, exactly like the primary loop's own
 * opt-in; without it, this still genuinely computes anomalies, competing
 * hypotheses, provenance, state-graph inconsistencies, and attack chains
 * from whatever was already collected, and persists all of it for
 * inspection.
 *
 * Batched concurrent execution: up to `ResearchTrackBudget.maxConcurrentExperiments`
 * experiments run together via `Promise.all` when they target distinct
 * (kind, target) pairs — genuinely independent work, since none of them
 * reads another's result before running. Selection within a batch stays
 * synchronous and sequential (each pick immediately claims its
 * `executedActionKeys` entry before the next pick runs, so two batch
 * members can never collide), and every result is folded back into
 * `researchHypotheses`/`findings` sequentially once the whole batch
 * settles, so there is no concurrent mutation of shared state. A
 * `shannon`-kind experiment's budget check-and-increment happens
 * synchronously before that member's first `await`, so
 * `maxShannonExecutions` is still enforced exactly even when multiple
 * Shannon-kind candidates land in the same batch. `reasoning/policy.ts`'s
 * `ToolRateLimiter` is itself concurrency-safe by construction (per-tool
 * FIFO queues), so real recon adapters sharing a batch never bypass rate
 * limiting.
