/**
 * Adaptive recon + reasoning loop.
 *
 * This is the controller: SCOPE -> DISCOVER -> ENUMERATE -> CORRELATE ->
 * UNDERSTAND -> OBSERVE -> HYPOTHESIZE -> PRIORITIZE -> SELECT NEXT-BEST
 * ACTION -> INVESTIGATE -> LEARN -> UPDATE MODEL -> REPEAT -> VALIDATE ->
 * EVIDENCE -> DEDUPLICATE -> REPORT DRAFT.
 *
 * Everything before the round loop (recon bootstrap: passive/active
 * sources, JS intelligence, behavioral diffs) runs once, only on a fresh
 * hunt — a resumed hunt reloads the world model and hypotheses from disk
 * instead of re-discovering them.
 *
 * Each round, a `ReasoningProvider` (Claude-backed when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
 * is configured, the deterministic heuristic provider otherwise — see
 * `reasoning/router.ts`) *proposes* the next-best action; the proposal is
 * never trusted directly. `reasoning/policy.ts:evaluateProposal` is the
 * deterministic gate: a proposal is only accepted if it matches, field for
 * field, a real entry already in this round's action queue (built straight
 * from the real world model) and fits the configured budget. A rejected
 * proposal (a hallucinated target, or none at all) falls back to the plain
 * deterministic selection over the same real queue — the hunt never stalls
 * because reasoning failed. Every round's decision, accepted or not, is
 * recorded in `checkpoint.decisions`.
 *
 * "Executing" an action means reading a caller-supplied investigation
 * fixture by default — including, for a `shannon` action, a captured
 * Shannon output file. A `shannon` action can instead run Shannon for
 * real, but only when the caller passes `liveShannon: { confirmed: true }`
 * explicitly; nothing in this loop ever sets that on its own, regardless
 * of which reasoning provider selected the action.
 *
 * No action ever runs against an asset that is not in scope: every
 * observation is passed through `recon/scope-tagging.ts:filterInScopeObservations`
 * before it can influence a hypothesis.
