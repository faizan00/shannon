/**
 * Shared Shannon action execution.
 *
 * The one authoritative path that turns a "shannon"-kind `HuntAction` into
 * either a safe dry-run plan (the default) or a real, explicitly-confirmed
 * live execution — extracted here from `pipeline/adaptive-loop.ts` so
 * `pipeline/research-track.ts` can reuse the exact same logic instead of a
 * second implementation. Every rule this module enforces is unchanged from
 * the original: `shannon/eligibility.ts` (a real local repo must exist),
 * `shannon/config.ts`'s verified invocation builder, and `confirmed: true`
 * as the only thing that can make
 * `shannon/execution-adapter.ts:executeShannonAction` — the only function
 * in this entire package that can spawn a process — actually run.
 *
 * Neither caller ever sets `liveShannon.confirmed` on its own; it is always
 * threaded through from an explicit, top-level operator decision
 * (`AdaptiveHuntInput.liveShannon` for the primary loop,
 * `AdaptiveHuntInput.researchTrack.live.shannon` for the research track).
 *
 * ROE is checked here too, before eligibility: a program that declares
 * "shannon"/"exploitation"/"automated exploitation" (or any alias
 * `discovery/roe.ts` recognizes) as a disallowed technique blocks a
 * "shannon" action outright — dry-run planning included, since even
 * *planning* a Shannon invocation is meaningless when the program has said
 * it must never run.

 * `(kind, target)`) previously left `workspace` unset on every invocation
 * — relying entirely on Shannon's own URL+timestamp auto-naming (see the
 * root `CLAUDE.md`'s "Workspaces & Resume") to keep two simultaneous runs'
 * state apart. That is not a guaranteed-distinct identity (two invocations
 * launched within the same auto-naming timestamp granularity could collide
 * in principle), and it gives a human inspecting `./shannon scans`
 * afterward no way to tell which Shannon run belonged to which Hunter
 * action. Hashing `engagementId::targetRef` fixes both: same input always
 * reproduces the same workspace name (so a retried/duplicate action key
 * reuses, rather than orphans, its own prior Shannon workspace), and
 * distinct targets — which is always true for any two members of the same
 * concurrent batch, see `research-track.ts:buildAvailableExperiments` —
 * always get distinct names.
